# Drone Path Visualization with PyVista

This project simulates a drone's flight path over a randomly generated terrain map and visualizes it in real-time using PyVista. The script also checks if the drone gets too close to the terrain surface and generates a report of such close encounters.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pip package manager

### Install Required Python Packages
To install the required Python packages, run:
```sh
pip install numpy pyvista
